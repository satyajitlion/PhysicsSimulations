# Physics Simulations

A collection of computational physics projects combining Python programming with fundamental physics concepts. These simulations serve as both learning tools and visual demonstrations of physical principles.

## Solar System Simulation
![Solar System](SolarSystemAnimation.gif)

A python simulation of a small-scale model Solar System using Newtonian gravity and visualized with Matplotlib.

## Lorentz Transformation Simulation
![lorentz transform](LorentzAnimation.gif)

A visualization of special relativistic effects occurring at relativistic velocities (v ≈ c). The β parameter (where β = v/c) quantifies the object's speed as a fraction of light speed, with space-time distortion becoming significant as β → 1.
